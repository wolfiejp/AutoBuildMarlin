# Auto Build Marlin

"Auto Build Marlin" provides a one-button interface to build and upload Marlin Firmware to your selected `MOTHERBOARD`, removing the need to edit your `platformio.ini` file or scroll through a long list of Marlin environments.

## Get PlatformIO

When installing "Auto Build Marlin" you'll also be prompted to install the [PlatformIO extension](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html). This is required for "Auto Build Marlin" to function.

## Usage

- Open up the downloaded *Marlin Firmware* project folder (***NOT the "Marlin" folder within***) in *Visual Studio Code*. (You may also use the **Import Projectâ€¦** option from the "PlaformIO Home" page.)

- With Marlin open, the "File Explorer" should be firmly rooted in your Marlin Firmware folder:
